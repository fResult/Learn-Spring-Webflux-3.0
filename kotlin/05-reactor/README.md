# 05 Reactor (Kotlin)

[‚Üê Back to Main README](../../README.md)

This module is based on concepts from the [reactor repository](https://github.com/reactive-spring-book/reactor) with my adaptations.

## Implementation Details

- Implemented reactive programming concepts using Kotlin and Project Reactor
- Used thread-safe counters and decorators to monitor thread execution
- Created custom schedulers and thread factories for better control over execution context
- Applied reactive patterns like `subscribeOn` for controlling execution threads
- Implemented proper error handling and backpressure management
- Used `StepVerifier` for testing asynchronous reactive streams
- Created proxies with method interception for monitoring scheduler execution

## Differences from Original

- Replaced `EmitterProcessor` with `Sinks.many().multicast().onBackpressureBuffer()` to address deprecation
- Replaced `ReplayProcessor` with `Sinks.many().replay().limit()` as a modern alternative
